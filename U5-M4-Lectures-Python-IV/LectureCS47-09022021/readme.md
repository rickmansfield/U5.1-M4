## Strings and Arrays

- recall the time and space complexity, the strengths and weaknesses, and basic operations of a static array
- describe the differences between in-place and out-of-place algorithms
- recall the time and space complexity, the strengths and weaknesses, and basic operations of a dynamic array

# Static Homogeneous Arrays
- static arrays can be used in languages such as C
- they are a fixed size and only contain data of a single types

```c
int arr[8] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 90, 2};
int arr2[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
```

# Static Hetrogeneous Arrays
- the Tuple in Python

```python
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, "Five")
```
